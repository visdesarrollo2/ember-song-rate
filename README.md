## Libraries

### Ember.js
Ember.js is an MVC framework for the front-end. Compared to AngularJS, Ember.js is a bit more strict. When creating an application you start by extending existing stuff (ObjectController, ArrayController, Component, View, Model, ...).
It allows you to follow the MVC design pattern and to loosely couple your view and the logic behind it. This improves the design of your application and it makes it easier to test it as well.
